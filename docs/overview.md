title: Overview of Kulupu
---

Kulupu is a self-updating self-governed blockchain system, using
proof-of-work as its consensus engine. Kulupu is built with the
Substrate framework. It is one of the first blockchains that combine
proof-of-work consensus engine with forkless upgrades.

## Proof of work

Kulupu has all the normal features youâ€™d expect in a proof of work
blockchain.

* **No pre-mine.** Kulupu was launched in September 2019, with 0 coin in its genesis block. It then emits 1 KLP per second to miners, till today.
* **ASIC-resistant.** Kulupu uses the battle tested RandomX mining algorithm from Monero.
* Like any decentralized blockchain system, it is censorship resistant, accessible to everyone, peer-to-peer and permission-less.

## Unique Kulupu features

In addition, Kulupu contains several unique features:

* **On-chain governance and forkless upgrade.** Kulupu has an on-chain
  democracy system. Users and a democratically elected council can
  submit referendum proposals, which are voted by coin holders. This
  user-driven governance system allows Kulupu to enact runtime upgrade
  much more easily, and with much reduced risk of network split,
  compared with hard-fork-based governance systems. The same system
  also allows upgrading the consensus, including mining algorithm and
  difficulty adjustment algorithm.
* **Voluntary taxation and treasury.** A democracy governance system
  allows Kulupu to build a public-good treasury system, with coin
  holders having the final say on how funds are spent. The treasury
  taxation is fair, and at the same time voluntary, reducing the risk
  of centralization and misuse.
* **Actor-based smart contract.** Actor-based smart contract aims at
  solving some of the outstanding issues in normal call-based smart
  contract system, improving backward compatibility, fee payment and
  other areas.
* **Interoperability with Polkadot.** By using Substrate, building on
  the same framework that Polkadot is built on, Kulupu allows easy
  interoperaibility with Polkadot in the future.
